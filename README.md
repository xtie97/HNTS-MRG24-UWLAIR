## üöÄ Overview
Accurate segmentation of gross tumor volume (GTV) is crucial for effective MRI-guided adaptive radiotherapy (MRgART) in head and neck cancer. Manual segmentation is labor-intensive and susceptible to interobserver variability. This project aims to address these challenges by leveraging **deep learning (DL)** models to automatically delineate GTVs on both **pre-radiotherapy (pre-RT)** and **mid-radiotherapy (mid-RT)** MRI scans. 

We present a series of DL models for longitudinal GTV segmentation, offering potential to streamline radiation oncology workflows in ART.

## Key Features
- **Pre-Radiotherapy (Pre-RT) GTV Segmentation (Task 1)**:  
  The DL models trained on combined pre-RT and mid-RT MRI datasets, yielding improved accuracy on hold-out test sets compared to models trained solely on pre-RT data.
  
- **Mid-Radiotherapy (Mid-RT) GTV Segmentation (Task 2)**:  
  The DL models integrating prior information from pre-RT scans can significantly improve the performance. Introduced **mask-aware attention modules** to leverage pre-RT GTV masks in mid-RT segmentation. 

- **Ensemble Approach**:  
  Utilized an ensemble of 10 models for both tasks to improve robustness and overall performance.

## üìä Results and Performance
- **Pre-Radiotherapy (Task 1)**:
  - Average **DSCagg**: 0.794
  - **Primary GTV (GTVp)** DSC: 0.745
  - **Metastatic Lymph Nodes (GTVn)** DSC: 0.844

- **Mid-Radiotherapy (Task 2)**:
  - Average **DSCagg**: xxx
  - **GTVp** DSC: xxx
  - **GTVn** DSC: xxx
